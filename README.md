## ðŸš§ Project Status ðŸš§

This project is currently under construction. Although many of the core features are implemented, we are still working on improvements and adding functionality. During this development phase, significant changes to the code and project structure may occur.

## Firebase configuration

```js
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_APIKEY,
  authDomain: import.meta.env.VITE_AUTHDOMAIN,
  projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_PROJECTID,
  storageBucket: import.meta.env.VITE_STORAGEBUCKET,
  messagingSenderId: import.meta.env.VITE_MESSAGINGSENDERID,
  appId: import.meta.env.VITE_APPID
};
```

You must create a `.env` file with the keys like this:

```js
VITE_APIKEY = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' 
VITE_AUTHDOMAIN = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
VITE_PROJECTID = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
VITE_STORAGEBUCKET = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
VITE_MESSAGINGSENDERID = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
VITE_APPID = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
